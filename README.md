# ATK Tutorial

**Work in progress**: tutorial is not written yet, so this repository is incomplete.

This repository holds code for the [Atk Framework tutorial](https://github.com/Sintattica/atk/doc/README.md) :

- Final state of the code in src/ directory (don't forget to run `composer update` before running it !)
- Data structures and samples int tutorial-data/ directory.

If you'd like to improve it, feel free to add PRs and to edit the [tutorial](https://github.com/Sintattica/atk/doc/README.md) accordingly.
